<h2>Zicong's Project Mission</h2>
  <p> My project began with the mission to create a course website of a Political Science class - Ancient Political Theory. The minor reason behind this is that this class does not have any online information either on Moodle or on google, which is inconvinient for students and people who have interetes. My main goal in developing this website is to make it functional, modern, and appropriate for the theme. </p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>I decided to use a one-page format. It is a popular trend and reduces unnecessary users actions on clicking and figuring out the page. Also, becasue there are not many informations, a single page is enough. However, I did use lines and heading to differentiate different sections. The first part of this website is a big title and a beautiful painting, because I want to directly point out the theme of this website. The painting (The School of Athens) can also gives users an classic atmosphere of this course, and indicates the focus on Athens in this class. </p>

<h3>Color</h3>
	<p>I use grey and black color in this website. They are all carefully selected to create a sense of Classics and elegence. Grey is not just a random grey, and black is not true black. Titles have darker color and paragraphs have lighter color. The also chose a specific font style from google font. Besides, I change the opacity and roundness of images to make them more coherent. </p>
<h3>Whitespace</h3>
	<p>The space between each sections, sentences, and images are intentionally placed. I also changed line space to make everything looks clear. </p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>There is a fixed navigation bar on top of the page. While people scrolling the pager, the bar is stable. User can jump to different sections of the pager by clicking the list on the upper right corner.  </p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
	<p> Besides the interaction of the navigation bar, there are interaction on the images section. When the mouse is on the image, the opacity will change, indicating the position of mouse, and then users can click images and go to wikipedia pages to get more information about those philosophers.</p>
	<p>The landscape images have auto slideshow effect.</p>
